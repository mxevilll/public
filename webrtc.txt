Script Description: WebRTC Streaming and Payment-Integrated Socket Server
This script is a WebSocket-based real-time communication server for live video streaming and monetized interactions using Socket.IO and PeerJS. It enables streamers to broadcast live video to viewers while supporting real-time chat, payments, and private sessions.

üìå Key Features:
1. WebRTC-Based Video Streaming
Uses PeerJS to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) connections.
Supports streamers (broadcasters) and viewers (watchers).
Notifies viewers when a streamer is ready or disconnects.
2. Real-Time Chat with WebSockets
Users can send and receive messages within their respective rooms.
Messages are broadcasted to all users in the same room.
3. Live Viewer Count Updates
Tracks the number of viewers in a stream and updates the UI dynamically.
Ensures streamers get real-time feedback on their audience size.
4. Integrated Payment System
Viewers can make payments to streamers.
The server splits the payment amount, crediting half to the streamer.
Starts a 900-second countdown timer after a payment is made.
5. Private Session Handling
When a viewer makes a payment, the server:
Credits tokens to the streamer.
Sends a "viewer-paid" event to notify the streamer.
Starts a private session timer.
Streamers can end all private sessions manually.
6. Automatic Cleanup on Disconnect
If a viewer disconnects, their count is updated.
If a streamer disconnects, their room is cleared and notified.
